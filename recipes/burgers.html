    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This zinger-style chicken burger features a crispy, golden-fried chicken patty packed with bold flavor and crunch. It's layered with crisp iceberg lettuce and spicy jalape√±os, all tucked inside a soft bun.

    <p>
    A perfect balance of heat and texture, this burger skips the traditional tomatoes and onions for a spicier, more focused flavor. It's a quick, satisfying meal that's easy to make at home and tastes just like your favorite fast-food chicken burger.
